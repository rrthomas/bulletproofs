Bulletproofs are short zero-knowledge arguments of knowledge that do not require a trusted setup.
Argument systems are proof systems with computational soundness.

Bulletproofs are suitable for proving statements on committed values, such as range proofs, verifiable shuffles, arithmetic circuits, etc.
They rely on the discrete logarithmic assumption and are made non-interactive using
the Fiat-Shamir heuristic.

The core algorithm of Bulletproofs is the inner-product algorithm presented by Groth [2].
The algorithm provides an argument of knowledge of two binding vector Pedersen commitments that satisfy a given inner product relation.
Bulletproofs build on the techniques of Bootle et al. [3] to introduce a communication efficient inner-product proof that reduces
overall communication complexity of the argument to only 2log<sub>2</sub>(n) where n is the dimension
of the two vectors of commitments.


Range proofs
============

Bulletproofs present a protocol for conducting short and aggregatable range proofs.
They encode a proof of the range of a committed number in an inner product, using polynomials.
Range proofs are proofs that a secret value lies in a certain interval.
Range proofs do not leak any information about the secret value, other
than the fact that they lie in the interval.

The proof algorithm can be sketched out in 5 steps:

Let _v_ be a value in _[0, n)_ and **a<sub>L</sub>** a vector of bit such that <**a<sub>L</sub>**, **2<sup>n</sup>**> = _v_.
The components of **a<sub>L</sub>** are the binary digits of _v_.
We construct a complementary vector **a<sub>R</sub>** = **a<sub>L</sub>** − **1**<sup>n</sup>
and require that **a<sub>L</sub>** ◦ **a<sub>R</sub>** = 0 holds.

- **P -> V : A, S** - where A and S are blinded Pedersen commitments to **a<sub>L</sub>** and **a<sub>R</sub>**.

- **V -> P : y, z** - Verifier sends challenges _y_ and _z_ to fix **A** and **S**.

- **P -> V : T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>** - where T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> are commitments to
the coefficients t<sub>1</sub>, of a polynomial t constructed from the existing values in the protocol.

- **V -> P : x** - Verifier challenges Prover with value _x_.

- **P -> V : tau, mu, t, l, r** - Prover sends several commitments that the verifier will then check.

See [Prover.hs](https://github.com/adjoint-io/bulletproofs/blob/master/Bulletproofs/RangeProof/Prover.hs "Prover.hs") for implementation details.

The interaction described is made non-interactive using the Fiat-Shamir Transform wherein all the random
challenges made by V are replaced with a hash of the transcript up until that point.

Inner-product range proof
=========================

The size of the proof is further reduced by leveraging the compact O(log<sub>n</sub>) inner product proof.

The inner-product argument in the protocol allows to prove knowledge of vectors **l** and **r**, whose inner product is _t_ and
the commitment _P_ ∈  _G_ is a commitment of these two vectors. We can therefore replace sending
(tau, mu, t, **l**, **r**) with a transfer of (tau, mu, t) and an execution of an inner product argument.

Then, instead of sharing **l** and **r**, which has a communication cost of 2n elements, the inner-product
argument transmits only 2 [log<sub>2</sub>] + 2 elements. In total, the prover sends only 2 [log<sub>2</sub>(n)] + 4
group elements and 5 elements in _Z_<sub>p</sub>

Aggregating Logarithmic Proofs
==============================

We can construct a single proof of range of multiple values, while only incurring an additional space cost of 2 log<sub>2</sub>(m) for
_m_ additional values _v_, as opposed to a multiplicative factor of _m_ when creating _m_ independent range proofs.

The aggregate range proof makes use of the inner product argument. It uses 2 [log<sub>2</sub> (n * m)] + 4 group elements and 5 elements in Z<sub>p</sub>.

See [Multi range proof example](https://github.com/adjoint-io/bulletproofs/tree/master#multi-range-proof)


Usage
=====

Single range proof:
-------------------

```haskell
import qualified Bulletproofs.RangeProof as RP

testSingleRangeProof :: (Integer, Integer) -> IO Bool
testSingleRangeProof (v, vBlinding) = do
  let vCommit = commit v vBlinding
      -- n needs to be a power of 2
      n = 2 ^ 8
      upperBound = 2 ^ n

  -- Prover
  proofE <- runExceptT $ RP.generateProof upperBound (v, vBlinding)

  -- Verifier
  case proofE of
    Left err -> panic $ show err
    Right (proof@RangeProof{..})
      -> pure $ RP.verifyProof upperBound vCommit proof
```

Multi range proof:
------------------

```haskell
import qualified Bulletproofs.MultiRangeProof as MRP

testMultiRangeProof :: [(Integer, Integer)] -> IO Bool
testMultiRangeProof vsAndvBlindings = do
  let vCommits = fmap (uncurry commit) vsAndvBlindings
      -- n needs to be a power of 2
      n = 2 ^ 8
      upperBound = 2 ^ n

  -- Prover
  proofE <- runExceptT $ MRP.generateProof upperBound vsAndvBlindings

  -- Verifier
  case proofE of
    Left err -> panic $ show err
    Right (proof@RangeProof{..})
      -> pure $ MRP.verifyProof upperBound vCommits proof
```


The dimension _n_ needs to be a power of 2.
This implementation offers support for SECp256k1, a Koblitz curve.

Zero-knowledge proof for Arithmetic Circuits
============================================

An arithmetic circuit over a field and variables (a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub>) is a directed acyclic graph whose vertices are called gates.

Arithmetic circuit can be described alternatively as a list of multiplication gates with a collection of linear consistency equations
relating the inputs and outputs of the gates. Any circuit described as an acyclic graph can be efficiently converted into this alternative description.

Bulletproofs present a protocol to generate zero-knowledge argument for arithmetic circuits using the inner product argument,
which allows to get a proof of size 2 log<sub>2</sub>(n) + 13 elements and include committed values as inputs to the arithmetic circuit.

In the protocol, the Prover proves that the hadamard product of _a<sub>L</sub>_ and _a<sub>R</sub>_ and a set of linear constraints hold.
The input values _v_ used to generate the proof are then committed and shared with the Verifier.

```haskell
import qualified Bulletproofs.ArithmeticCircuit

--  Example:
--  2 linear constraints (q = 2):
--  aL[0] + aL[1] + aL[2] + aL[3] = v[0]
--  aR[0] + aR[1] + aR[2] + aR[3] = v[1]
--
--  4 multiplication constraints (implicit) (n = 4):
--  aL[0] * aR[0] = aO[0]
--  aL[1] * aR[1] = aO[1]
--  aL[2] * aR[2] = aO[2]
--  aL[3] * aR[3] = aO[3]
--
--  2 input values (m = 2)
